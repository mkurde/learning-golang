# Interfaces

An interface is a collection of method signatures that a Type can implement
(using methods). Hence interface defines (not declares) the behavior of the
object (of the type Type).

> An interface also works in a similar way like a struct by dynamically holding
> a reference to the underlying type.

To successfully implement an interface, you need to implement all the methods declared by the interface with exact signatures.
